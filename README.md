## Market Research
In the film industry, market research is generally qualitative and the data that is collated from surveys, reviews, and post-screening reactions is usually done manually. Some film companies, however, are taking advantage of emotion detection software and are using it to determine how moviegoers are enjoying their films. They do this by letting the software capture people’s faces and track facial behavior using infrared cameras during movie screenings.

All this is done in real-time which generates reliable data, helping movie production companies get a more accurate picture of audience responses. Ultimately, what these companies get out of this, is greater insight into what provokes an emotion.
